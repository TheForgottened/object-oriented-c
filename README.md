# Object-oriented C

Small CUI game written in object-oriented C.

This game was inspired by the final assignment for the OOP class I attended during my degree in Computer Science & Engineering at ISEC. You can check the original project [here](https://github.com/JOSEALM3IDA/Material-ISEC/tree/main/POO-2020/Trabalho) (it's all in portuguese).
