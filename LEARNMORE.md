During the project I realized that the way I did things didn't exactly compile into machine code similar to what the `C++` equivalent would. My initial objective was to get the syntax in `C` as close to `C++` as possible, and that's what I did, so I'm quite happy. Just thought I should share this since it may be important depending on what you intend to do.

These should be a good place to start, but I recommend reading as much as possible regarding the subject, I find it really interesting.

You can also find a bunch of examples of OOP in C in the [Linux's source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).
